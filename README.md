This anonymous message board will let you post a new text message to the board. All you have to do is type your message into the input box and submit!

Once you've posted your message (or even before – there are a couple of example posts in there to get you started) you can like, unlike or delete it.

Be careful deleting your message – once it's gone, it's gone and you can't retrieve it again.

You can use the filter buttons to sort the messages on the message board by most recently posted (latest) to the oldest, and by the amount of likes on the post (most to least and the inverse).

You can also search through the messages on the message board. Try not to make any typos - this project doesn't match those (yet) – but feel free to type in upper, lower, sentence mixed case, whichever you choose. You can even filter your search results using the same filter buttons.

Once you've done searching, you can clear your search results and all the posts will show up again.
